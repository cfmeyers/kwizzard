#Kwizard:  A Simple Command Line Quizzer

##Inspired by Erica Kantor's [code_review_questions](https://github.com/ericak11/code_review_questions)

##To Do

-  [ ]  it reads in all the files in the `./questions` directory

    -  [ ]  it saves topics based on the file names (e.g. `python.yaml` will create a "python" topic)
    
    -  [ ]  it reads all the question/answer pairs and adds them to the question array

    -  [ ]  it syntax highlights code for `python.yaml`, `ruby.yaml`, and `javascript.yaml` files

-  [ ]  it continually loops, asking random questions

-  [ ]  hitting enter will display the answer
